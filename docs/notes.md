# The professional approach (canonical template)

## A landing page for an org needs 3 jobs:

1. Explain (mission)
2. Prove (festival photos / impact / partners)
3. Convert (contact / participate)

## Section order (this is the default “NGO/Community org landing” blueprint)

- Hero
- What we do (3 pillars) — super scannable
- Festival Highlight — proof + emotion + CTA
- Programs / Training — concrete offerings
- Impact / Testimonials — trust (even if qualitative)
- CTA band — “Partner / Participate / Contact”
- Footer

## Mini “architect’s checklist” (use forever)

### For every section, answer in 10 seconds:

1. What question does this section answer?
2. What proof does it show?
3. What action should the user take next?

> If you can’t answer those, the section is fluff.
